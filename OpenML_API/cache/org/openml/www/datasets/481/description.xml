February 23, 1982

The 1982 annual meetings of the American Statistical Association (ASA)
will be held August 16-19, 1982 in Cincinnati.  At that meeting, the ASA
Committee on Statistical Graphics plans to sponsor an &quot;Exposition of
Statistical Graphics Technology.&quot;  The purpose of this activity is to
more fully inform the ASA membership about the capabilities and uses of
computer graphcis in statistical work.   This letter is to invite you to
participate in the Exposition.

Attached is a set of biomedical data containing 209 observations (134
for &quot;normals&quot; and 75 for &quot;carriers&quot;).  Each vendor of provider of
statistical graphics software participating in the Exposition is to
analyze these data using their software and to prepare tabular, graphical
and text output illustrating the use of graphics in these analyses and
summarizing their conclusions.  The tabular and graphical materials must be
direct computer output from the statistical graphics software; the
textual descriptions and summaries need not be.  The total display space
available to each participant at the meeting will be a standard poster-
board (approximately 4' x 2 1/2').  All entries will be displayed in one
location at the meetings, together with brief written commentary by
the committee summarizing the results of this activity.

THE DATA

The following data arose in a study to develop screening methods to
identify carriers of a rare genetic disorder. Four measurements m1,
m2, m3, m4 were made on blood samples. One of these, m1, has been used
before.

The disease is Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Measurements are:  
M1- serum creatine kinase.  
M2- hemopexin.  
M3- pyruvate kinase.  
M4- lactate dehydrogenase.  

Because the disease is rare, there are only a few carriers of
the disease from whom data are available. The data come in two files,
one for normals and one for carriers of the disease. A description of
the files is provided. The data have been stripped of the names and
other identifiers. Otherwise the data are as received by the analyst.


PURPOSE OF THE ANALYSIS

The purpose of the analysis is to develop a screening procedure to
detect carriers and to describe its effectiveness.  Experts in the
field have noted that young people tend to have higher measurements.
The laboratory which prepared the measurements is worried that there
may be a systematic drift over time in their measurement process.
These effects should be considered in the analysis.  Can graphical
displays show the differences between the distributions of carriers
and normals?
