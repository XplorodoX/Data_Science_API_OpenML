The USNEWS dataset for the ASA Statistical Graphics Section's
1995 Data Analysis Exposition contains information on over 1300
American colleges and universities.  The data may be obtained in
either of two formats.

USNEWS.DATA contains the raw data in comma delimited fields with
a single data line for each school. The order of variables is the
same as given below for the fixed column version, although the
spacing varies for each school.

USNEWS3.DATA has the data arranged in fixed columns, with three
data lines for each school and a maximum line length of 80
characters.

This dataset is taken from the 1995 U.S. News &amp; World Report's
Guide to America's Best Colleges.  This dataset is protected by
copyright, is reproduced with permission of the copyright
holder(s), and may not be downloaded or otherwise copied, except
solely for the purpose of analysis in connection with the
American Statistical Association's 1995 Data Analysis Exposition.
The data are reporduced with the permission of the publisher.

Most of the data are for the 1993-94 school year. You may wish to
consult a copy of the U.S. News source for more detailed
descriptions of the variables.

WHAT'S WHAT AMONG AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES?

This is the subject of the 1995 Data Analysis Exposition
sponsored by the Statistical Graphics Section of the American
Statistical Association.  The purpose of the Exposition is to
encourage statisticians to demonstrate techniques, especially
graphical, for analyzing data and displaying the results of an
analysis.  Individuals and groups will work with the same set of
data and present their analyses at a special session as part of
the annual Joint Statistical Meetings in Orlando, Florida on
August 13th-17th, 1995.  The datasets for 1995 are drawn from two
sources, U.S. News &amp; World Report's Guide to Americas Best
Colleges and the AAUP (American Association of University
Professors) 1994 Salary Survey which appeared in the March-April
1994 issue of Academe.

The U.S. News data contains information on tuition, room &amp; board
costs, SAT or ACT scores, application/acceptance rates,
graduation rate, student/faculty ratio, spending per student, and
a number of other variables for 1300+ schools. The AAUP data
includes average salary, overall compensation, and number of
faculty broken down by full, associate, and assistant professor
ranks.

The raw data and documentation are contained in the files
described below.  To obtain any of these files send a message to
statlib@lib.stat.cmu.edu of the following form  (substituting the
file you want for XXXXX)

send XXXXX from colleges

Available files

usnews.doc      Documentation for the U.S. News data
usnews.data     U.S. News data in comma delimited format
usnews3.data    U.S. News data in fixed column format

aaup.doc        Documentation for the AAUP salary data
aaup.data       AAUP salary data in comma delimited format
aaup2.data      AAUP salary data in fixed column format

Two versions of each dataset are provided to accommodate users
with different software constraints.  The comma delimited
versions (USNEWS.DATA and AAUP.DATA) contain information for each
college on a separate line with values delimited by commas.  The
fixed column versions (USNEWS3.DATA and AAUP2.DATA) use 2 or 3
data lines per school and a maximum line length of 80 characters.

To participate in the 1995 Data Analysis Exposition you must send
an abstract form to the American Statistical Association by
February 1st, 1995.  Information is available from the ASA
Meetings Department by e-mail (meetings@asa.mhs.compuserve.com),
phone (703-684-1221), fax (703-684-2037), or surface mail (ASA,
1429 Duke St., Alexandria, VA 22314).  Your initial abstract may
be fairly general since you may do the bulk of your analysis
after the February 1 deadline.

You may choose your own path to proceed in analyzing the data or
use some of the suggested questions below to get started.

... How well can we model tuition using the other variables?
... How might we cluster colleges into similar comparison groups?
... How can we best display faculty salary structure?
... Can we find a reasonable way to rank the schools?

You may work on your own or put together a team.  Show off the
capabilities of your favorite software package or use the data
for a class project and display your students results.  You may
choose to consider just a subset of schools or examine regional
patterns.  The main point is to find innovative ways to display
the interesting features of the data.

Further questions about the 1995 Exposition can be directed to
Robin Lock, Mathematics Department, St. Lawrence University,
Canton, NY 13617  e-mail   rlock@vm.stlawu.edu

If you would like to be informed about any subsequent adjustments
or error fixes to the 1995 Exposition data, please send an e-mail
message to register your interest to rlock@vm.stlawu.edu.

Special thanks for providing data for the 1995 Exposition to:
Robert Morse, Director of Research for America's Best Colleges at
U.S. News &amp; World Report
Maryse Eymonerie, Consultant to AAUP.
