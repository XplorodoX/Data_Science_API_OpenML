Data on the homicide rate in Detroit for the years 1961-1973. This is the data set called DETROIT in the book 'Subset selection in regression' by Alan J. Miller published in the Chapman &amp; Hall series of monographs on Statistics &amp; Applied Probability, no. 40. The data are unusual in that a subset of three predictors can be found which gives a very much better fit to the data than the subsets found from the Efroymson stepwise algorithm, or from forward selection or backward elimination.

The original data were given in appendix A of `Regression analysis and its application: A data-oriented approach' by Gunst &amp; Mason, Statistics textbooks and monographs no. 24, Marcel Dekker. It has caused problems because some copies of the Gunst &amp; Mason book do not contain all of the data, and because Miller does not say which variables he used as predictors and which is the dependent variable. (HOM was the dependent variable, and the predictors were FTP ... WE)

The data were collected by J.C. Fisher and used in his paper: &quot;Homicide in Detroit: The Role of Firearms&quot;, Criminology, vol.14, 387-400 (1976)
