The data are recorded in two ASCII files, PLACES.DAT, and
PLACES.KEY .  The first file contains 329 observations, 9 columns
plus an index column.  The index stands for the location.  PLACES.KEY
gives the index in the first column and the associated name of the
place in the second column.  All data analysis can be done with
numeric variables and the index, as read in from PLACES.DAT .
Alternatively, the numerical key can be replaced by the alphabetic
name, as given by PLACES.KEY .
