NAME: Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks
 
 SUMMARY: This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study
 of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network [1].  The
 task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced
 off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.
 
 SOURCE: The data set was contributed to the benchmark collection by Terry
 Sejnowski, now at the Salk Institute and the University of California at
 San Deigo.  The data set was developed in collaboration with R. Paul
 Gorman of Allied-Signal Aerospace Technology Center.

 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
 
 The file &quot;sonar.mines&quot; contains 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar
 signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various
 conditions.  The file &quot;sonar.rocks&quot; contains 97 patterns obtained from
 rocks under similar conditions.  The transmitted sonar signal is a
 frequency-modulated chirp, rising in frequency.  The data set contains
 signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90
 degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock.
 
 Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  Each number
 represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over
 a certain period of time.  The integration aperture for higher frequencies
 occur later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during
 the chirp.
 
 The label associated with each record contains the letter &quot;R&quot; if the object
 is a rock and &quot;M&quot; if it is a mine (metal cylinder).  The numbers in the
 labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the
 angle directly.
 
 METHODOLOGY: 
 
 This data set can be used in a number of different ways to test learning
 speed, quality of ultimate learning, ability to generalize, or combinations
 of these factors.
 
 In [1], Gorman and Sejnowski report two series of experiments: an
 &quot;aspect-angle independent&quot; series, in which the whole data set is used
 without controlling for aspect angle, and an &quot;aspect-angle dependent&quot;
 series in which the training and testing sets were carefully controlled to
 ensure that each set contained cases from each aspect angle in
 appropriate proportions.
 
 For the aspect-angle independent experiments the combined set of 208 cases
 is divided randomly into 13 disjoint sets with 16 cases in each.  For each
 experiment, 12 of these sets are used as training data, while the 13th is
 reserved for testing.  The experiment is repeated 13 times so that every
 case appears once as part of a test set.  The reported performance is an
 average over the entire set of 13 different test sets, each run 10 times.
 
 It was observed that this random division of the sample set led to rather
 uneven performance.  A few of the splits gave poor results, presumably
 because the test set contains some samples from aspect angles that are
 under-represented in the corresponding training set.  This motivated Gorman
 and Sejnowski to devise a different set of experiments in which an attempt
 was made to balance the training and test sets so that each would have a
 representative number of samples from all aspect angles.  Since detailed
 aspect angle information was not present in the data base of samples, the
 208 samples were first divided into clusters, using a 60-dimensional
 Euclidian metric; each of these clusters was then divided between the
 104-member training set and the 104-member test set.  
 
 The actual training and testing samples used for the &quot;aspect angle
 dependent&quot; experiments are marked in the data files.  The reported
 performance is an average over 10 runs with this single division of the
 data set.
 
 A standard back-propagation network was used for all experiments.  The
 network had 60 inputs and 2 output units, one indicating a cylinder and the
 other a rock.  Experiments were run with no hidden units (direct
 connections from each input to each output) and with a single hidden layer
 with 2, 3, 6, 12, or 24 units.  Each network was trained by 300 epochs over
 the entire training set.
 
 The weight-update formulas used in this study were slightly different from
 the standard form.  A learning rate of 2.0 and momentum of 0.0 was used.
 Errors less than 0.2 were treated as zero.  Initial weights were uniform
 random values in the range -0.3 to +0.3.
 
 RESULTS: 
 
 For the angle independent experiments, Gorman and Sejnowski report the
 following results for networks with different numbers of hidden units:
 
 Hidden	% Right on	Std.	% Right on	Std.
 Units	Training set	Dev.	Test Set	Dev.
 ------	------------	----	----------	----
 0	89.4		2.1	77.1		8.3
 2	96.5		0.7	81.9		6.2
 3	98.8		0.4	82.0		7.3
 6	99.7		0.2	83.5		5.6
 12	99.8		0.1	84.7		5.7
 24	99.8		0.1	84.5		5.7
 
 For the angle-dependent experiments Gorman and Sejnowski report the
 following results:
 
 Hidden	% Right on	Std.	% Right on	Std.
 Units	Training set	Dev.	Test Set	Dev.
 ------	------------	----	----------	----
 0	79.3		3.4	73.1		4.8
 2	96.2		2.2	85.7		6.3
 3	98.1		1.5	87.6		3.0
 6	99.4		0.9	89.3		2.4
 12	99.8		0.6	90.4		1.8
 24     100.0		0.0	89.2		1.4
 
 Not surprisingly, the network's performance on the test set was somewhat
 better when the aspect angles in the training and test sets were balanced.
 
 Gorman and Sejnowski further report that a nearest neighbor classifier on
 the same data gave an 82.7% probability of correct classification.
 
 Three trained human subjects were each tested on 100 signals, chosen at
 random from the set of 208 returns used to create this data set.  Their
 responses ranged between 88% and 97% correct.  However, they may have been
 using information from the raw sonar signal that is not preserved in the
 processed data sets presented here.
