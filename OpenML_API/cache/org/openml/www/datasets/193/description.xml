 SUMMARY:
 
 Data from an experiment on the affects of machine adjustments on

 A manufacturer of automotive accessories provides hardware, e.g. nuts,
 bolts, washers and screws, to fasten the accessory to the car or truck.
 Hardware is counted and packaged automatically.  Specifically, bolts
 are dumped into a large metal dish.  A plate that forms the bottom of
 the dish rotates counterclockwise.  This rotation forces bolts to the
 outside of the dish and up along a narrow ledge.  Due to the vibration
 of the dish caused by the spinning bottom plate, some bolts fall off 
 the ledge and back into the dish.  The ledge spirals up to a point 
 where the bolts are allowed to drop into a pan on a conveyor belt.  
 As a bolt drops, it passes by an electronic eye that counts it.  When 
 the electronic counter reaches the preset number of bolts, the
 rotation is stopped and the conveyor belt is moved forward.  
 
 There are several adjustments on the machine that affect its operation.  
 These include; a speed setting that controls the speed of rotation
 (SPEED1) of the plate at the bottom of the dish, a total number of 
 bolts (TOTAL) to be counted, a second speed setting (SPEED2) that is 
 used to change the speed of rotation (usually slowing it down) for the
 last few bolts, the number of bolts to be counted at this second speed
 (NUMBER2), and the sensitivity of the electronic eye (SENS).  The 
 sensitivity setting is to insure that the correct number of bolts are 
 counted.  Too few bolts packaged causes customer complaints.  Too many
 bolts packaged increases costs.  For each run conducted in this 
 experiment the correct number of bolts was counted.  From an
 engineering standpoint if the correct number of bolts is counted, the 
 sensitivity should not affect the time to count bolts.  The measured 
 response is the time (TIME), in seconds, it takes to count the desired
 number of bolts.  In order to put times on a equal footing the
 response to be analyzed is the time to count 20 bolts (T20BOLT).
 Below are the data for 40 combinations of settings.  RUN is the order 
 in which the data were collected.
 
 Analyze the data.  What adjustments have the greatest effect on the 
 time to count 20 bolts?  How would you adjust the machine to get
 the shortest time to count 20 bolts?  Are there any unusual features
 to the data?
